# PE or Price-to-Earnings ratio. It's the number which best reflects the current value of a company. 
# This number shows you how much investor money, or your money it takes to generate $1 of company profit. 
# If the PE is 100, it means for every $100 you invest in a company that company can generate $1 of profit. 
# Historically, average PEs have been around 15 to 17 for US companies. So 100 means the stock is extremely expensive.
